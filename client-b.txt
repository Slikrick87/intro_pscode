- declare user location variables named (userLocationX, userLocationY) create input parameters
- declare item location (itemLocationX, itemLocationY) create parameters based on stores size

- have user input customers coordinates (userLocationX, userLocationY)
- have user input the location they wish to visit as (itemLocationX, itemLocationY)

  while
